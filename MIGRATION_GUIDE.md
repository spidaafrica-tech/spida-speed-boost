At LIFT-OFF 2025, SPIDA was honored with the Sustainable Land Use Award, recognizing our commitment to transforming African agriculture through technology and sustainable practices. This award validates our mission to create inclusive, digitally connected agricultural ecosystems that benefit both farmers and the environment.

Speaking after the award, our CEO shared: "This award is more than just a recognition: it is a validation of the hard work of our team, the significance of our solution, and the belief that sustainable agriculture is the path forward for Africa. We dedicate this to every smallholder farmer who wakes up each day with the hope of feeding their family, their community, and the world. At SPIDA, our goal is simply to enhance productivity, improve market access and cut food loss by up to 45%."

This achievement marks only the beginning of our journey. With 1,000 farmers already onboarded in North-Central Nigeria, SPIDA is proving that technology can overcome long-standing barriers such as fragmentation, illiteracy, and poor market access. We are now setting our sights on expanding our farmer network beyond Nigeria, deepening collaborations with food processors and agribusinesses, enhancing our digital platform with even more farmer-friendly tools, and strengthening our efforts toward climate-smart practices that safeguard both land and livelihoods.

Winning this award inspires us to push even harder, think bolder, and remain steadfast in our mission to transform African agriculture from the ground up.

As we look ahead, we extend an open invitation to investors, collaborators, and partners who share our vision of sustainable and inclusive agriculture. Together, we can unlock opportunities for millions of farmers across Africa, ensuring that they are not just participants but leaders in the digital agricultural revolution.

## Post 2 Content (Farmer Onboarding)

**Title**: Bringing Agritech Solutions to the People That Matter: SPIDA Onboards 1,000 Farmers in North-Central Nigeria

**Excerpt**: A milestone achievement as we successfully onboard 1,000 smallholder farmers across farming communities in Ilorin, Kwara State.

**Content** (Rich Text):

At SPIDA, we believe technology should serve the people who matter most - the farmers who feed our communities. Across Africa, however, smallholder farmers are frequently overlooked. Fragmented production systems, limited access to education, and entrenched poverty have kept many of them from benefiting from agritech solutions that could dramatically improve their productivity and livelihoods.

This is the gap SPIDA is working to close. Between 24th and 28th July 2025, our team conducted an onboarding exercise and field surveys across the farming communities of Reke, Ori Eru, Afon, Ogbondoroko, and Asa L.G.A in Ilorin, Kwara State. The result was the successful onboarding of 1000 smallholder farmers onto the SPIDA platform which forms our first major step in building an inclusive, digitally connected agricultural ecosystem in North-Central Nigeria.

The onboarding process was designed to do more than simply add names to our platform. Farmers were registered and profiled into our database, and then grouped according to key characteristics such as crop type, farm size, income levels and location. They participated in orientation sessions where they were introduced to SPIDA's products and the benefits of digital agriculture, while a number of lead farmers were selected to serve as early adopters and peer connectors within their communities. This approach ensures that adoption is not only top-down but also community-driven.

This is the first step of many to provide farmers access to tools that were once out of reach. Onboarded farmers will have access to reliable and data-driven insights to guide planting, seamless access to affordable tractors. They are also directly connected to buyers and processors, through SPIDA's B2C and B2B marketplace giving them fairer prices and eliminating exploitative middlemen. Perhaps most importantly, these farmers can now have access to an automatically produced digital records of all farm transaction via SPIDA that can support access to financial services, opening a pathway toward true inclusion in the agricultural economy.

The excitement within the communities has been inspiring. One farmer summed it up best when he said: "I am personally excited about this initiative. It gives me hope for the future that I too can access tractors like bigger farmers to improve my yield. More importantly, knowing I won't have to worry about markets, and that I can secure better prices for my produce, is something we never expected. Thank you, SPIDA, we are ever ready to work with you."

For SPIDA, this milestone is only the beginning. With one thousand farmers now onboarded in Kwara State, we are committed to scaling this model across Nigeria and the African continent. Our focus remains on ensuring accessibility, inclusion, and productivity for smallholders everywhere.

Our mission is simple but bold: to digitally empower farmers, enabling them to farm smarter, be efficient, productive, and reduce food loss and exploitation posed by the prevailing poor market structures in Nigeria and by extension Africa.

SPIDA is building the future of African agriculture, one farmer at a time. If you are a farmer seeking digital solutions, a processor or buyer looking for transparent supply chains, or a partner who believes in empowering communities through technology, we invite you to join us. Together, we can create an Africa where farmers thrive and agriculture is powered by innovation.
